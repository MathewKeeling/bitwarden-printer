# bitwarden-printer
Prints the contents of your Bitwarden JSON export in a way that is friendly to the eyes.

## Overview
```
This script will accept a standard format, freshly generated, JSON export from your bitwarden account. It will print it to the terminal in way that is easy to read.

You can feel free to modify this to print to a text document for your purposes. I found it easier to simply go and increase the buffer size of my IDE's terminal.

I spent about six or seven hours on this so you don't have to. If you found this helpful--feel free to star this repository and give me a follow. I'm always looking to teach and learn. (I have much to do of the latter.)

Thanks for stopping by!
